# 🏠 Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction with Front-End Integration

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where you'll build a **Linear Regression Machine Learning Model** to predict house prices in the USA — and connect it to a **beautiful front-end using HTML**. This end-to-end project guides you through data exploration, model building, and deployment with an interactive user interface.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
A real estate agent needs help predicting house prices based on regional features. You've been provided with a dataset and tasked with building a **predictive model** using **Linear Regression**.

Your goal is to create a solution that provides **accurate house price estimates** and a **user-friendly web interface** for use in the real estate business.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Rows**: 5000
- **Columns**: 7
- **File Type**: CSV

### Features:
| Column Name                      | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Avg. Area Income`              | Average income of householder in the area                   |
| `Avg. Area House Age`           | Average age of houses in the area                           |
| `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`     | Average number of rooms                                      |
| `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`  | Average number of bedrooms                                   |
| `Area Population`               | Population of the region                                     |
| `Price`                         | **Target** - Price the house was sold at                    |
| `Address`                       | Physical address of the property (not used in modeling)     |

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Clean the data
   - Visualize correlations
   - Understand feature distributions

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets
   - Normalize if needed

3. **Modeling**
   - Build a **Linear Regression** model
   - Train it on the dataset
   - Evaluate using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE

4. **Prediction**
   - Predict prices for unseen data
   - Test with real-world inputs

5. **Front-End Integration**
   - Use the provided `HTML` template for user interaction
   - Backend processes user input and returns predictions

---

## 💡 Instructions

1. Clone the project or download the files.
2. Extract the `template.zip` and make sure the `HTML` file is in the `templates/` folder.
3. Train and run your Flask/Django app.
4. Visit the HTML page to interact with your model!

---

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
- HTML/CSS for front-end
- Flask (or Django) for back-end integration

---

## 🌟 Results
With the model trained on 5000 samples and tuned properly, you can achieve a high prediction accuracy to assist real estate agents with confident pricing estimates.
